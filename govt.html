        <h2>1.Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h2>
            <p>SNAP, commonly known as food stamps, is a federal program that provides
                 low-income individuals and families with funds to purchase groceries. 
                 The program issues benefits through an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card,
                  which can be used at most grocery stores and some farmers' markets. SNAP aims 
                  to improve food security and promote access to nutritious foods. Eligibility 
                  is based on income, household size, and other factors.</p>
        <h2>2.Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program</h2>
             <p>The WIC program supports low-income pregnant women, new mothers, 
                and children under the age of five by providing healthy food, nutrition
                 education, and breastfeeding support. Participants receive vouchers or 
                 an EBT card to purchase nutritious foods such as milk, eggs, fruits, and
                  vegetables. The program also offers healthcare referrals and nutrition
                   counseling to ensure proper child development and maternal health.</p>
        <h2>3.National School Lunch Program (NSLP) & School Breakfast Program (SBP)</h2>
            <p>These federally assisted meal programs provide free or reduced-price meals
                 to children in public and nonprofit private schools. The goal is to ensure
                  that children receive balanced meals that support their academic performance
                   and overall health. The programs follow federal nutrition guidelines to 
                   provide wholesome meals, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein sources.</p>
        <h2>4.The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP)</h2>
             <p>TEFAP is a federal program that supplies food banks and pantries with free,
                 nutritious food for low-income families. The program distributes USDA-purchased 
                 food to local agencies, which then provide food assistance to households in need.
                  TEFAP helps to supplement the diets of individuals facing food insecurity by 
                  providing essential staples such as canned goods, frozen meats, and dairy products.</p>
        <h2>5.Meals on Wheels</h2>
            <p>Meals on Wheels is a community-based program that delivers nutritious meals to 
                seniors who are homebound or have difficulty preparing their own food. The program 
                not only provides food but also offers regular wellness checks and social interaction 
                to reduce isolation among the elderly. Funded through government grants and community 
                donations, Meals on Wheels helps seniors maintain independence while ensuring they receive adequate nutrition.</p>
        <h2>6.Summer Food Service Program (SFSP)</h2>
            <p>SFSP provides free meals to children in low-income areas during the summer months
                 when school is not in session. This program ensures that children who rely on 
                 school meals during the academic year continue to receive nutritious food. Local 
                 schools, nonprofit organizations, and community centers serve as meal distribution 
                 sites to help prevent child hunger during summer break.</p>
        <h2>7.Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP)</h2>
            <p>CSFP is designed to improve the health of low-income seniors aged 60 and older
                 by providing them with nutritious food packages. These food packages include a
                  variety of staple foods such as canned fruits and vegetables, dairy products,
                   grains, and proteins. The program aims to reduce food insecurity and support 
                   the dietary needs of elderly individuals who may struggle with access to healthy food.</p>
        <h2>8.Poshan Abhiyaan (National Nutrition Mission)</h2>
            <p> Launched by the Government of India in 2018, this mission aims to tackle malnutrition 
                and improve nutritional outcomes for children, adolescent girls, pregnant women, and 
                lactating mothers. It focuses on promoting behavior change and leveraging technology 
                to monitor progress. The initiative includes awareness campaigns about proper diet, 
                hygiene, and health practices to reduce stunting, undernutrition, anemia, and low birth weights.</p>
        <h2>9.Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS</h2>
            <p>This is one of Indiaâ€™s flagship welfare schemes for children under six years of age and their mothers.
                 The program offers a range of services, including supplementary nutrition, pre-school education,
                  immunization, health check-ups, and referral services. Anganwadi centers (rural child care centers)
                  serve as the focal points for delivering these services, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations 
                  receive holistic care.</p>
